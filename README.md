# Python data analysis

This is a repo of basic data analysis technicques using python. The tutorials are stored here as iptython notebooks.

## Tutorial 1 - getting set up

To get started you will need the following:
- python installed on your machine (I'm using 3.8.2)
- a virtual environment set up
- the packages used can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install this using `pip install -r requirements.txt` from your virtual environment.
